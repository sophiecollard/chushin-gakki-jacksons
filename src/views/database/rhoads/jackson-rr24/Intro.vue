      Possibly the most popular Rhoads models ever.
      Up until the release of the RR24 in late 2006, guitarists outside of Japan looking for a 24-frets Rhoads were left to choose between the entry-level JS30RR and a USA Custom Shop order.

      The RR24 was first introduced in late 2006 as a limited edition.
      It featured a black finish with yellow bevels and logo, an ivory neck binding and reverse sharkfin inlays.
      A standard version was later announced at NAMM 2007, available in three different finishes and featuring a black neck binding and regular sharkfin inlays.
