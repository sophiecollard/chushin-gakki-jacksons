      A high-end model released for the domestic Japanese market only.
      The Custom series is a contemporary of the early 90s Pro series and you can expect a similar level of craftmanship on this model as on the famed <router-link to="/db/rr/jackson-rr-pro">Rhoads Pro</router-link>.

      While the first iteration of the RR Custom had 22 frets, Jackson switched to 24 frets around 1991, making it (to my knowledge) the first 24-frets Rhoads catalogue model.
